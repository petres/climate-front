## aim

Providing bare weather data visualisation to get an basic idea of the ocurring climate change.


## data

The [European Climate Assessment & Dataset project](https://www.ecad.eu/) provides data for more than 15.000 weather stations in europe. 

The data used is not provided in this repository. The raw data can be downloaded [here](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/predefinedseries.php).
The raw data needs some preparation steps which are quite straightforward, I will add the code of these preparation steps in an extra repo. To run this repo you can download the prepared data used on the web server [https://climate.abteil.org/data](https://climate.abteil.org/data.tar.gz).
